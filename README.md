KDAB's Android gems

**Build your UI layout**
Android Studio includes a layout editor that allows you to build and preview your app UI by dragging elements into a visual design editor instead of writing layout XML by hand.


**Profile your app performance**
Poor app performance can ruin the user experience and destroy your app's reputation. If it ever responds slowly, shows choppy animations, freezes, crashes, or consumes a lot of power, your users will notice. To avoid these performance problems, use the Android Profiler to measure your app's memory, CPU, and network usage.
